/**
 * Prominent "we're crawling your site" banner for the current website. Drop it
 * at the top of any page whose data the first crawl builds (dashboard, pages,
 * link structure, keywords, competitor discovery, rank tracking). The view polls
 * so it appears when a crawl starts and disappears when it finishes.
 *
 * On the dashboard it also drives the crawl-derived widgets: when the running
 * state flips it emits `crawl-state-changed`, which Site Health / the action
 * queue listen for to hide during the first crawl and reappear once it's done.
 * On other pages that event simply has no listeners.
