/**
 * One pass of a multi-pass crawl. Selects the pages due for crawling that have
 * NOT yet been fetched this run, fans them out across CrawlPageBatchJob children,
 * and — when that batch finishes — dispatches the NEXT pass. Pages discovered
 * mid-run (on-page links that created stub rows, e.g. the homepage's category
 * pages) are due + uncrawled, so the next pass picks them up. The loop ends when
 * a pass finds nothing new, the pass cap is reached, or the per-run page cap is
 * hit; then AnalyzeSiteJob computes the link graph + findings + scores.
 *
 * This is what makes the link graph reach the whole site from the homepage:
 * a single pass only crawls the pre-selected frontier and leaves linked-to stubs
 * uncrawled (no outbound edges → disconnected graph → false orphan/deep flags).
