/**
 * Admin grid for per-website feature flags. Each row is a connected
 * website; each column is one of `Website::FEATURE_KEYS`. Toggling a
 * cell flips the boolean in `websites.feature_flags` JSON; the WP
 * plugin picks up the change on its next API call (passive sync via
 * `EBQ_Feature_Flags::store()` reading the `features` field on every
 * response) — and at the latest within 12 hours when the cached
 * transient on the WP side expires.
 *
 * Layout follows the existing `Admin\ClientController` pattern: a
 * single index() that returns a Blade view + an update() that handles
 * the toggle POST and redirects back. No Livewire — keeps the page
 * fast and the shape predictable for an admin-only surface.
