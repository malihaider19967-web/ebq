                <h2>1. 1-month free trial — no charge</h2>
                <p>Every paid plan starts with a <strong>1-month free trial</strong>. Cancel anytime during the trial and your card is never charged. There's nothing to refund because nothing was paid. We collect a payment method at sign-up so the plan converts seamlessly when the trial ends, but the first charge only happens at the end of the trial.</p>

                <h2>2. 14-day money-back guarantee on the first annual charge</h2>
                <p>Once your trial converts and we charge you for the first annual subscription, you have a <strong>14-day window from that charge</strong> to request a full refund — no questionnaire, no friction. Email <a href="mailto:billing@ebq.io">billing@ebq.io</a> and we will refund the entire first annual charge to the original payment method.</p>
                <p>This applies to your <em>first</em> annual term only. Subsequent renewals are not covered by the 14-day guarantee but may be eligible for a pro-rata refund (see §4).</p>

                <h2>3. Cancel anytime</h2>
                <p>You can cancel your subscription from <strong>Settings → Billing</strong> at any time. Cancellation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Stops the next annual renewal.</li>
                    <li>Lets you keep using the plan until the end of the current annual term you've already paid for.</li>
                    <li>Does not retroactively refund the year you already paid for, except under the 14-day post-charge guarantee or the conditions in §4.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Pro-rata refunds for service issues</h2>
                <p>If we materially break the Service for an extended period (significant feature removal on a paid plan, prolonged outage beyond what's reasonable for SaaS, billing errors), we will refund the affected portion of your annual subscription on a pro-rata basis. Email <a href="mailto:billing@ebq.io">billing@ebq.io</a> with the affected dates and we'll work it out.</p>

                <h2>5. Annual subscriptions</h2>
                <p>EBQ paid plans are sold annually only. If you cancel after the 14-day post-charge window:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Service continues until the annual term ends.</li>
                    <li>No automatic refund of the unused months.</li>
                    <li>If circumstances change mid-year (closing the business, agency client churn, etc.) reach out — we review case-by-case and will issue a pro-rata refund for the unused months when the situation warrants it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Add-ons and extras</h2>
                <p>Add-on purchases (extra websites, extra keyword slots, extra audit credits) are billed alongside your annual plan. They're refundable under the same 14-day post-charge window as the base plan; outside that, unused credits roll forward to the next renewal but aren't refunded in cash.</p>

                <h2>7. What's not refundable</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annual renewal charges (after the first year), once the 14-day post-charge window has passed.</li>
                    <li>Add-on credits already consumed (e.g. audits already run, AI generations already returned, indexing-API submissions already sent).</li>
                    <li>Sales tax / VAT collected on behalf of tax authorities — those are returned through your local refund mechanism, not by us directly.</li>
                    <li>Charges resulting from misuse of the Service in breach of our <a href="{{ route('terms-conditions') }}">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>8. How to request a refund</h2>
                <p>Email <a href="mailto:billing@ebq.io">billing@ebq.io</a> from the email associated with your EBQ account. Include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your workspace name (or the email used to sign up).</li>
                    <li>The charge date / invoice number you want refunded.</li>
                    <li>(Optional) A short note about why — useful feedback for us, not a gating question.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We respond within 2 business days and process approved refunds within 5–10 business days, depending on your bank. Refunds go back to the original payment method.</p>

                <h2>9. Chargebacks</h2>
                <p>Please contact us before initiating a chargeback — almost every billing question is faster to resolve directly. Disputes filed without contacting us first may result in account suspension while we work with the payment processor.</p>

                <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this policy. Material changes are posted on this page and notified to active subscribers by email at least 14 days before they take effect. Refund eligibility for charges made <em>before</em> the change is governed by the policy in force at the time of the charge.</p>

                <h2>11. Contact</h2>
                <p>Billing questions: <a href="mailto:billing@ebq.io">billing@ebq.io</a>. We're a small team and we read every message.</p>
