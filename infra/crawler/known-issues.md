# Known issues & gaps

Verified against the current code (2026-06-16, shared-crawl deep-dive). These are real
behaviours to be aware of — some are bugs to fix, some are accepted trade-offs.

## Bugs / inconsistencies

### Cap-window leak — `LinkStructurePanel::render` (~lines 68-72)
The Link Structure panel's "example pages" picker reads the top-8 pages by
`inbound_link_count` **across the whole crawl_site**, via a raw `WebsitePage` query, with
**no `value_rank <= cap` filter**:

```php
\App\Models\WebsitePage::where('crawl_site_id', $website->crawl_site_id)
    ->whereNotNull('last_crawled_at')->whereNull('removed_at')
    ->orderByDesc('inbound_link_count')->limit(8)->pluck('url');
```

Every other read path enforces the cap window; this one doesn't, so a small-cap user can be
shown example URLs outside their window. **Severity: low** (only suggestion URLs in an input
helper, not data/metrics). **Fix:** source the examples through `CrawlReportService`
(cap-filtered) or add `->where('value_rank', '<=', $cap)`.

## Accepted trade-offs (intentional, documented so they're not "discovered" as bugs)

### Unbounded-by-cap link reads
`CrawlReportService::bfsParents` (homepage→page BFS for orphan/path detection) and
`pageLinkStructure` (a page's inbound + outbound, ≤500 each) read the **full** link graph
without the cap window. The *page* in question is cap-checked; its neighbours are not.
Accepted because correct structure/orphan detection needs the whole graph. Revisit only if
it ever surfaces cross-cap URLs directly to a user.

### Sitemap-delta dispatch is per-website
`CrawlSitemapDeltaJob` dedupes per crawl_site (its `uniqueId`), but then triggers
`CrawlWebsitePagesJob($website->id)` for the subscriber that saw the delta. If several
subscribers' deltas fire, several dispatches occur — but the `crawl-site-{id}`
`ShouldBeUnique` lock + the start-lock collapse them to **one** crawl. Safe, just slightly
redundant dispatch.

### Analysis is best-effort
If `AnalyzeSiteJob` throws partway, its `failed()` handler still marks the run `completed`
(so it isn't stuck `running`), but findings / score / link graph may be partial. The run's
`notes` records the failure. Chosen over leaving runs wedged on huge sites.

## Reliability

- **Wedge (mitigated, not eliminated).** The multi-pass loop continues only via the
  `Bus::batch` `->finally()` callback; a worker recycle/restart mid-batch can drop it, leaving
  a run stuck `running`. **`ebq:crawl-supervisor`** (every 5 min, `stall_minutes` default 10)
  resumes/finalizes such runs — so a wedge self-heals within ~10 min rather than never, but the
  pipeline now *depends on* the watchdog. The supervisor is time-based, so a run whose next
  pass is merely queued behind a slow backlog can be re-dispatched (a harmless duplicate
  upsert). See [pipeline.md](./pipeline.md) §Reliability.
- **Slow fetch throughput.** Observed ~1.5 pages/sec under load (≈90s per 25-page batch),
  dominated by per-page fetch latency (proxy `on_block` retries + politeness delay + target
  speed), not the pipeline. It's the biggest lever on "big sites take a long time" and is
  un-investigated.
- **Proxy pool: import vs. health-check are two separate commands (2026-06-20) — don't
  conflate them.** Both live-test via the shared `ProxyPool::testBatch()` (concurrent
  HTTPS GET to `api.ipify.org`, cert verification ON — catches dead nodes AND the rarer
  MITM ones that swap in a self-signed cert; confirmed against a live sample of
  `iplocate/free-proxy-list` + `proxifly/free-proxy-list`, both `scheme://host:port` form).
  1. **`ebq:proxy-list-refresh`** — import-only, never touches already-tracked rows. Pulls
     candidate URLs from free public lists (`--source` repeatable; a failed source just
     warns and is skipped), tests a random `--limit` sample of *new* ones, inserts only the
     passers (label `free-proxy-list (auto)`). Scheduled `everyThirtyMinutes` but **gated
     OFF by default** via `CRAWLER_PROXY_AUTO_IMPORT` (`config/crawler.php` `proxy.auto_import`)
     — the command itself always works regardless of the flag; only the *automatic* firing is
     gated. Manual trigger: `php artisan ebq:proxy-list-refresh`, or the admin
     `/admin/proxies` **"Import now"** button (dispatches `RunProxyListRefreshJob` on the
     `default` queue so the click doesn't block on a multi-source fetch + test pass).
  2. **`ebq:proxy-pool-prune`** — health-check-only, never imports. Tests every
     already-tracked proxy and **deletes it immediately on a single failed test** — no
     fail_count/threshold, each run is a fresh independent check. Scheduled
     `everyFifteenMinutes`, **always on**, NOT gated by `auto_import` (that flag only
     controls new imports; the pool must stay clean even with import off).
  3. **Real-usage failures** — `ProxyPool::markFailure()`, called from actual production use
     (`PageAuditService`/`LinkChecker`'s broken-link checkers, `PageCrawlProcessor`'s
     page-fetch retry) — still deletes after `CRAWLER_PROXY_MAX_FAILURES` consecutive real
     failures, independent of the two scheduled commands above.
  4. **Admin "Retest all"** (`/admin/proxies`) — manual bulk sweep, same delete-on-first-fail
     semantics as the pruner, client-driven (Alpine, concurrency 5, live progress).
  Both scheduled commands run only on the web box's scheduler (`schedule:work`), so no
  worker-box (box B) deploy is needed for changes to either — box B only needed redeploying
  because `ProxyPool.php` itself (the shared `testBatch()`/`markFailure()` code) is also used
  by `LinkChecker`/`PageCrawlProcessor`, which DO run there.
  Free proxies are inherently low-trust (unknown operators, can see plaintext HTTP and
  attempt HTTPS MITM) — fine for the crawler's anti-block use case (fetching public pages),
  would NOT be fine for anything carrying credentials/PII.

## Large-site pressure points

- **In-memory graph BFS** — `SiteGraphAnalyzer` loads the adjacency list into memory for
  inbound-count + click-depth BFS (O(V+E)). Assumes the link graph fits in RAM. As of
  2026-06-18 the adjacency is **integer-indexed** (dense int ids, not 26-char ULIDs) and built
  in a **single edge pass**, and the BFS uses a **pointer queue** (not `array_shift`, which is
  O(n²)) — this is what lets a ~1.5M-edge / ~168k-page site (xplate) finalize in budget.
- **`AnalyzeSiteJob` timeout** — raised to **3600s** (2026-06-18) after a ~168k-page/~1.5M-edge
  site (xplate) timed out mid-`SiteIssueDetector::detect` even with the graph optimized. Runs on a
  dedicated **`redis-long`** queue connection whose `retry_after=3900` is a **code default**
  (`config/queue.php`), so the ceiling travels with the deploy — no per-box `.env` edit, and a
  still-running finalize is never re-reserved. `tries=2` so one transient failure no longer strands
  the run. The heavy steps (`detect`, suggester, value_rank) are all chunked/cursor-bounded → no OOM.
- **Referrer / external-link sampling** — broken-referrer sampling (5/target, ~50k edge cap)
  and external-link checking (≤25/page, ≤500 total) are bounded, so on pathological fan-in or
  link-heavy pages the coverage is partial by design.

### 2026-06-18 incident — finalize failed on large sites (1205 lock-wait + finalize loop)
Two `AnalyzeSiteJob`s failed (`MaxAttemptsExceeded`) on 39k- and 168k-page sites; one site
was left stuck in `finalizing`. Two compounding causes, both fixed:
1. **Table-wide UPDATEs in `SiteGraphAnalyzer`** — `recomputeInboundCounts` did a whole-site
   `UPDATE … JOIN` (+ whole-site reset) and `recomputeClickDepth` a whole-site reset. On
   40k–168k-row sites these held InnoDB row locks long enough to trip
   `innodb_lock_wait_timeout` (**SQLSTATE 1205**) — because finalize **contends with live
   `CrawlPageBatchJob` writes** to the same `website_pages` rows. **Fix:** both passes now
   compute in PHP (keyset stream) and write in **bounded id-keyset chunks**
   (`resetColumnChunked` / `writeGroupedChunked`). `CrawlValueRank::assign` was already chunked.
2. **Supervisor finalize loop / overlapping finalizes** — `CrawlSupervisor` re-dispatches
   `AnalyzeSiteJob` for any stalled `FINALIZING` run, but a slow-but-alive finalize (≤1200s)
   doesn't bump `updated_at`, so a **second concurrent finalize** could start and fight the
   first for the same row locks. **Fix:** `AnalyzeSiteJob` now carries
   `WithoutOverlapping('analyze-site:'.$crawlRunId)->dontRelease()->expireAfter(1500)` — the
   duplicate is dropped, the lock auto-expires if a holder dies hard. With `failed()` finalizing
   the run after `tries=2`, the loop is broken.

> Upstream contributor (crawl side, not yet fixed): the 50 sibling `CrawlPageBatchJob`
> **timeouts** that day broke `Bus::batch` completion and left pages selected-but-unfetched.
> `pages_seen` is incremented at **selection** (`CrawlPassJob.php:117`), not at successful
> fetch, so a run can hit its page cap with pages never actually crawled — the crawl looks
> "done at cap" while incomplete.

### 2026-06-23 — per-site hard cap to bound finalize cost on huge sites
Even with the 2026-06-18 fixes above, sites like xplate.com (100k+ pages) still made
`AnalyzeSiteJob` slow/risky to finalize — more crawled pages directly means more graph
edges, findings, and link-suggestion candidates for finalize to chew through, no matter how
well each step is chunked. **Fix:** a universal hard ceiling,
`config('crawler.max_pages_per_site')` (default 20,000, env `CRAWLER_MAX_PAGES_PER_SITE`),
now bounds every site's crawl depth regardless of plan. The owner's plan `max_crawl_pages`
was reinterpreted from a flat per-site number into an **account-wide pool** shared across
all the owner's sites — each site's actual cap is `min(hard cap, pool remaining after the
owner's other sites' usage)`, floored at 1 (never blocked outright). See
`Website::crawlPageCap()` and `infra/billing/plans-and-gating.md`.

## Transitional cruft

- The four crawl tables still carry a **nullable, FK-dropped, unused `website_id`** column
  (safe-rollback leftover from the re-key). Nothing reads/writes it. A future migration can
  `dropColumn('website_id')` once we're confident — not urgent.
- `websites` keeps legacy `sitemap_lastmod_true/false` + `crawl_protection*` columns; the
  canonical copies now live on `crawl_sites`. The `Website` helpers delegate to the crawl_site.
